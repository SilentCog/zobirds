# ZoBirds!

Project scaffolding created via the [Phaser Yeoman generator](https://github.com/codevinsky/generator-phaser-official)

## Game Objective

Its really just a simple game where a dog chase birds in a yard. A point is scored when a bird is caught.

Inspired by Zobie and Zorro chasing birds in the backyard ;)
